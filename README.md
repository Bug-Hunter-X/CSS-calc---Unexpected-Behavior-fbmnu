This repository demonstrates a common issue with the CSS `calc()` function: unexpected results due to unit incompatibility and operator precedence. The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected version.  The problem arises when mixing percentages and pixels within the `calc()` function without careful consideration of how the browser interprets the calculation.  The solution clarifies the calculation by ensuring consistent units or using explicit values to achieve the desired layout.
