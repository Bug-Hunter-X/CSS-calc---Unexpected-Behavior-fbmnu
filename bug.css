The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results when dealing with percentages and units that aren't directly compatible. For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not work as expected if the containing element's width is not explicitly set.  Another issue can arise from incorrect operator precedence within the `calc()` expression, leading to miscalculations.
